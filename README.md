# siamese
Implementation of a siamese neural network

This is a siamese network model based on deep learning neural networks written in Python using Pytorch.

Structure:
Network: Conv2D (for both query set and questioned sample) --> Dense
Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
  


1). Install packages from 'requirements.txt' in your environment.
3). src directory should contain directories: 'dataset'.
4). Place the dataset in 'dataset' directory.
5). Run training via 'siamese.py'.
